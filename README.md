# Adaptive Quiz System using Reinforcement Learning

This project is an intelligent, adaptive quiz platform built using Python and Flask. It leverages a custom reinforcement learning model to personalize question selection based on the student's proficiency level and topic performance. Students take a 30-question quiz spanning Math, Python, and Machine Learning topics. Their proficiency and scores are updated dynamically and stored in a persistent CSV file.

## Features

- Adaptive question selection based on student proficiency
- Reinforcement Learning model using sigmoid reward function
- Topic-wise performance tracking (Math, Python, ML)
- Persistent student performance storage in CSV
- Web-based user interface using Flask and Jinja2 templates
